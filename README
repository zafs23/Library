# Project 4: Reader of Books

* Author: Sajia Zafreen
* Class: CS121 Section 6
* Semester: Fall 2018 

## Overview

The program contains GUI where a reader can upload books in the library from files and 
read the selected book from there. 

## Compiling and Running
```
$ javac ReaderOfBooks.java
```
```
$ java ReaderOfBooks

```
##Extra Credit
The instruction says to implement a new interface to read the big files . However I have used another code
to read my files in the first place which doesn't use a scanner and that's why I didn't implemented the new method


## Sources used

Codes from the text book and stackoverflow.com helped to finish the project
To read the text files I took help from this web site : 
http://www.java67.com/2016/08/how-to-read-text-file-as-string-in-java.html
to edit JTextPane I have used:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3213045/centering-text-in-a-jtextarea-or-jtextpane-horizontal-text-alignment
but I didn't copy or pasted any code.

## Struggles and challenges

This Project was hard a took a while. I struggled a lot when I needed to implement action listener for the book buttons. 
I realized that if I load books after I implement the action listener in the reader of books panel then the book buttons 
are not connected to the action listener. So, I implemented the action listener to the load button and the book buttons
in the final panel: ReaderOfBooksPanel.
I also had to give some extra time to figure out the page numbers of the books.
